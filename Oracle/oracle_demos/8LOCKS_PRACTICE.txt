/*
Row Share: A row share lock held by a transaction allows others to query
any rows or insert new rows. Also users can update or delete rows other
than the ones on which lock is being held. As a result two transactions can
make changes to different rows in the same table at the same time, using
row share, row exclusive, share update and share row exclusive lock. A
transaction cannot acquire an exclusive lock on a table if another transaction
has already acquired the row share lock on that table.
*/

/*

Share Update: A share update lock is acquired for making changes to data
in table rows. When a transaction holds this lock, any other transaction can
acquire any other type of lock on a table except for a exclusive lock. This
lock is similar in behavior like the Row share lock

/*
Row Exclusive: A row-exclusive lock held by a transaction allows other
transactions to query any rows or insert new rows on the table while the rowexclusive
lock is being held. In addition, transactions can concurrently
process update or delete statements on rows other than those held under
the row-exclusive lock in the same table. Therefore, row-exclusive locks
allow multiple transactions to obtain simultaneous row-exclusive, share-row,
or share-update locks for different rows in the same table. However, while
one transaction holds a row-exclusive lock, no other transaction can make
changes to rows that the first transaction has changed until the first
transaction completes. Additionally, no transaction may obtain an exclusive,
share, or share-row-exclusive lock on a table while another transaction holds
a row-exclusive lock on that same table.*/
